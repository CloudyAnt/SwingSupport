[00:13.92]College English Test - Band 6
[00:17.23]Part II Listening Comprehension
[00:20.47]Section A
[00:22.11]Directions: In this section, 
[00:24.69]you will hear two long conversations. 
[00:27.18]At the end of each conversation, 
[00:29.34]you will hear some questions. 
[00:31.39]Both the conversation 
[00:32.69]and the questions will be spoken only once. 
[00:35.82]After you hear a question, 
[00:37.68]you must choose the best answer 
[00:39.44]from the four choices 
[00:40.79]marked A), B), C) and D). 
[00:44.89]Then mark the corresponding letter 
[00:47.08]on Answer Sheet 1 
[00:48.44]with a single line through the centre.
[00:51.33]Conversation One
[00:53.65]W: Well, tonight we have Andrew Green
[00:56.54]in our studio to talk about music.
[00:59.82]Andrew is a great guitarist and has his own band.
[01:03.75]So, Andrew, welcome.
[01:06.06]M: Thanks a lot. My pleasure to be here tonight.
[01:09.79]W: Now, Andrew, perhaps you could tell us something
[01:13.23]about the future trends for the global music industry?
[01:17.51]M: Sure. Well, from my perspective as a musician,
[01:22.04]I can see a dramatic increase
[01:24.15]in the popularity of Latin music, even now.
[01:27.98]If this trend continues,
[01:29.68]I imagine the popularity of Salsa dancing
[01:32.66]will also rise dramatically.
[01:34.60]This may result in a slight decrease
[01:37.17]in the popularity of other types of music.
[01:40.45]W: What do you think of
[01:41.48]the sudden drop in interest in classical music?
[01:45.31]M: I think this trend has been in the works for quite some time.
[01:49.09]As more and more varieties of music
[01:51.98]become available to consumers,
[01:53.87]the classic standards may suffer in the popularity contest.
[01:58.06]I think the drop in interest of classical music
[02:01.29]hasn't been sudden at all,
[02:03.40]it's been slow and steady for many years now.
[02:06.59]W: Is there any type of music
[02:08.43]that is consistently popular with most people?
[02:12.03]M: If you look at the numbers, rock and roll music
[02:15.26]has remained a steady constant through the years.
[02:18.35]I expect the popularity of rock and roll
[02:20.90]will stay the same in the coming years.
[02:23.89]W: It's said that rock music might make one livelier and happier.
[02:28.55]What do you think of it?
[02:30.10]M: That's true. Research suggests that
[02:33.01]music can influence a person's feelings and character.
[02:36.70]There's clear evidence that people
[02:38.89]who listen lively music are lively people.
[02:43.48]Questions 1 to 4 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[02:49.16]1. What kind of music will be 
[02:52.62]most popular in the future according to the man?
[03:12.34]2. What does the man think of people's interest in classical music?
[03:34.36]3. What kind of music is consistenly popular according to the man? 
[03:56.00]4.What does the man say about the rock music?
[04:16.18]Conversation Two
[04:18.33]M: Ms. Roth. This is David Wong from ABC Insurance Company.
[04:23.24]I'd like to make an appointment to see you
[04:25.53]about our insurance plans for foreign employees.
[04:28.98]W: Oh, how did you know my name?
[04:32.12]M: In fact, a friend of yours is one of my clients.
[04:36.01]He thinks that you may find it helpful
[04:38.00]to know more about insurance in Hong Kong.
[04:41.01]W: May I know who he is?
[04:42.85]M: Well, Ms. Roth. You'll know his name soon enough
[04:46.33]if you'll just let me see you.
[04:48.27]W: What kind of insurance are you talking about here?
[04:51.96]M: Well, it's rather comprehensive.
[04:54.54]That's why I'd like to see you personally
[04:57.14]so that I can present to you the products we have to offer.
[05:00.84]W: Sorry, Mr. Wong.
[05:02.29]My company has provided me a whole insurance package.
[05:06.12]M: Oh, I'm glad to hear that.
[05:08.34]But as I said, our insurance plans
[05:11.43]are specially designed for foreign staff like you.
[05:14.83]They are somewhat different and
[05:16.48]more beneficial to you I'm sure.
[05:18.74]And our meeting won't take longer than fifteen minutes.
[05:22.57]Will two o'clock tomorrow be convenient to you?
[05:26.56]W: Well, I've been very busy lately.
[05:29.69]M: Ms. Roth, as I said, it'll be a short appointment.
[05:34.11]I'm sure you'll find our products informative and useful.
[05:38.44]Perhaps when you need our service in the future,
[05:41.87]you'll know who to call.
[05:43.58]Will two tomorrow be okay to you?
[05:46.27]W: Well, then, make it three.
[05:48.63]M: Alright. I'll be there at your office tomorrow at three sharp.
[05:53.66]Questions 5 to 8 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[05:58.24]5. What does David Wong strongly recommend to Ms. Roth?
[06:19.04]6. Why does David Wong insist on seeing Ms. Roth in person?
[06:39.74]7. On what condition does Ms. Roth agree to see David Wong?
[07:01.25]8. What's the woman's attitude towards the insurance business?
[07:22.08]Section B
[07:23.57]Directions: In this section,
[07:26.05]you will hear two passages. 
[07:28.49]At the end of each passage, 
[07:30.13]you will hear some questions. 
[07:32.33]Both the passage and the questions 
[07:34.08]will be spoken only once. 
[07:36.36]After you hear a question, 
[07:37.96]you must choose the best answer 
[07:39.80]from the four choices 
[07:40.84]marked A), B), C) and D). 
[07:44.47]Then mark the corresponding letter 
[07:46.61]on Answer Sheet 1 
[07:48.05]with a single line through the centre.
[07:51.37]Passage One
[07:52.65]You probably don't have much in the way of savings,
[07:56.44]and with all your expenses,
[07:58.23]it doesn't look like you'll be able to improve that situation soon.
[08:02.41]If you wonder how to cut corners,
[08:05.21]there's an obvious place to look at your spending habits.
[08:08.85]Do you buy a soda each weekend?
[08:11.53]Waste one dollar a day for forty years,
[08:14.27]and when you are set to retire,
[08:16.26]you'll find your account is short by 190,000 dollars.
[08:22.03]Grab a calculator and you'll discover that, over forty years,
[08:26.76]going out to dinner twice a month
[08:29.10]at forty dollars each time amounts to half a million.
[08:33.28]Even a pack-a-day cigarette habit
[08:36.36]will lighten your retirement account by 330,000 dollars.
[08:41.59]And the same with cable TV and those cool earrings.
[08:46.31]They will probably amount to as much as one million.
[08:50.12]So, the first clue to accumulating wealth is this:
[08:54.36]focus on your spending habits.
[08:57.49]Here are a couple of tricks to help you save
[09:00.43]even if you swear you can't afford to.
[09:03.33]Stop buying things that fall rather than rise in value.
[09:07.97]Pay yourself first. Before you pay the monthly bills,
[09:12.35]send 25 dollars to a mutual fund.
[09:15.34]Stop spending coins.
[09:17.43]From now on, spend only paper currency,
[09:20.76]and keep the change every day.
[09:23.21]Get your family involved, and you'll double your savings.
[09:27.10]Use discount tickets at the supermarket,
[09:30.30]but use them correctly.
[09:32.20]How? If you really want to make these tickets worthwhile,
[09:36.23]you actually must invest into your mutual funds
[09:39.56]the amount you save by using the tickets.
[09:42.56]Otherwise, you are wasting your time and your money.
[09:47.59]Questions 9 to 11 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[09:52.72]9. What should one pay special attention to if he wants to save up?
[10:13.91]10. How much can a person save by retirement
[10:18.42]if he gives up his pack-a-day cigarette habit?
[10:36.72]11. What should one do before paying monthly bills,
[10:41.93]if he wants to accumulate wealth?
[10:59.48]Passage Two
[11:01.03]To finish today's program,
[11:02.87]I want to tell you about the Waterside Shopping Centre,
[11:06.75]near Northport, which I visited last week.
[11:09.95]It has something for everyone
[11:12.54]and I would recommend it for a day out.
[11:15.47]It's taken three years to build and finally opened three weeks ago,
[11:20.77]two months later than planned.
[11:23.33]Firstly, getting there; there are organized coach trips
[11:28.10]from most towns in the area
[11:29.86]but they leave early and come home very late, so I drove.
[11:35.13]There are 12,000 free parking spaces,
[11:39.11]so parking is no problem.
[11:41.75]You can also get there by train,
[11:44.29]but the station is 15 minutes from Waterside by bus,
[11:48.67]and the buses are really crowded,
[11:51.68]so you sometimes have a long wait.
[11:54.22]The shopping centre is arranged on three levels.
[11:58.85]You'll find all your favorites here.
[12:01.93]In fact if you want to buy a pair of shoes
[12:05.32]there are 15 different shops to choose from on levels one and two.
[12:11.59]When you run out of money there are seven different banks,
[12:16.08]but collect your money before you get to the third level
[12:19.86]as there aren't any banks up there.
[12:22.59]On that level, however, there are several restaurants,
[12:26.97]as well as a cinema with seven screens.
[12:30.47]And don't get lost like I did,
[12:33.25]go to the information desk on the first level and get a map.
[12:37.93]Before you go back to your car or the bus-
[12:41.37]and in fact it might be better to do this
[12:44.60]before you go shopping and have too much to carry-
[12:48.26]go and see the lake.
[12:50.17]Take a walk or have a go at fishing,
[12:53.61]sailing or windsurfing if you have time.
[12:57.09]Or you can rest your tired feet and watch the birds and ducks,
[13:01.82]but you are asked not to feed them.
[13:04.66]Questions 12 to 15 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[13:09.64]12. When was the shopping center opened?
[13:28.84]13. What is the best way of traveling to Waterside
[13:33.67]according to the speaker?
[13:50.74]14. What can you do on the third level?
[14:10.63]15. Apart from shopping, what else can you do at Waterside?
[14:31.25]Section C
[14:33.19]Directions: In this section, 
[14:36.28]you will hear recordings of lectures or talks 
[14:39.13]followed by some questions. 
[14:41.54]The recordings will be played only once. 
[14:44.13]After you hear a question, 
[14:46.21]you must choose the best answer 
[14:47.80]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D). 
[14:52.88]Then mark the corresponding letter 
[14:55.07]on Answer Sheet 1 with a single line through the centre.
[15:00.30]Now listen to the following recording and answer questions 16 to 18.
[15:06.68]For more than two centuries, 
[15:08.63]America's colleges and universities 
[15:11.21]have been the backbone of the country's progress. 
[15:14.46]They have educated the technical, 
[15:16.57]managerial and professional work force 
[15:19.21]and provided generation after generation of national leaders. 
[15:23.53]Today, educators from around the country 
[15:26.57]are up to find many reasons 
[15:28.56]for the excellence of American universities. 
[15:31.50]But four historic Acts stand out as a turning point.  
[15:35.88]First, education for the mass. 
[15:39.21]In 1862, Congress enacted 
[15:42.20]the Land Grant College Act, 
[15:44.19]which essentially extended the opportunity 
[15:46.48]of higher education to all Americans, 
[15:49.26]including women and minorities. 
[15:52.00]Each state was permitted to sell 
[15:53.99]large tracts of federal land, 
[15:56.14]and use the proceeds to endow at least one public college.  
[16:00.79]Second, competition breeds success. 
[16:04.62]Over the years, the decentralization and diversity 
[16:08.51]of the America's colleges and universities 
[16:11.25]have promoted competition for students and resources. 
[16:15.72]Competitive pressure first arose 
[16:18.02]during the Civil War when president Lincon 
[16:20.76]created the National Academy of Science 
[16:23.54]to advise Congress on any subject of science and art. 
[16:27.67]The Academy's impact really grew after World War II 
[16:31.95]when a landmark report commissioned by 
[16:35.13]the then president argued 
[16:36.88]that it was the federal government's responsibility 
[16:40.22]to provide adequate funds for basic research. 
[16:43.80]Instead of being centralized in government laboratories, 
[16:47.53]scientific research became decentralized 
[16:50.73]in American universities and generated increasing investment. 
[16:55.27]It also gave graduate students research opportunities 
[16:59.20]and helped spread scientific discoveries 
[17:01.84]far and wide, to the benefit of industry, 
[17:04.98]medicine and society as a whole.  
[17:07.77]Thirdly, investing in the future. 
[17:11.74]The end of World War II saw 
[17:14.69]the passage of the Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944.The law, 
[17:20.45]which provided for a college 
[17:22.14]or vocational education for returning veterans, 
[17:25.28]made the higher education system 
[17:27.57]accessible in ways that were inconceivable in Europe, 
[17:31.11]opening the doors of best universities 
[17:33.40]to men and women who had never dreamed of going to college.  
[17:38.02]Finally, promoting diversity. 
[17:40.37]The creation of federal loan and subsidy programs 
[17:43.92]as well as outright grants for 
[17:46.30]college students brought much needed 
[17:48.49]diversity to high education 
[17:50.58]and further helped to democratize access. 
[17:54.02]Since its founding in 1965, 
[17:56.55]the Federal Family Education Loan Program 
[17:59.59]has funded more than 74 million student loans 
[18:03.22]worth more than 180 billion dollars. 
[18:08.64]16. What has been the backbone of America's progress?
[18:30.28]17. Whose responsibility is to provide adequate funds for basic research?
[18:53.92]18. Which law provided for a college 
[18:58.06]or vocational education for returning veterans?
[19:16.07]Now listen to the following recording and answer questions 19 to 21.
[19:24.78]What's in a surname? You may ask. 
[19:28.16]A new website project has been released, 
[19:30.80]that helps you locate your past. 
[19:32.75]Have you ever wondered 
[19:34.60]why your ancestors gathered where they did, 
[19:36.94]or where others with your surname live? 
[19:39.70]A research project investigating 
[19:42.07]the distribution of surnames in Britain answers these questions. 
[19:46.30]And another study has found the surnames 
[19:48.79]are still extremely regional.
[19:51.53]Smith, for example, 
[19:53.50]remains the most common surname in Britain, 
[19:56.19]used by more than half a million people. 
[19:59.13]It has exactly the same concentration 
[20:02.13]it always did in Lerwick, 
[20:03.93]in the Scottish Shetland Islands. 
[20:05.77]Jones is the No. 2 surname, 
[20:08.27]and is the most common among hill farmers in north Wales.
[20:12.41]The data used for this project comes 
[20:15.25]partly from electoral register. 
[20:18.19]A number of other files are held by Ex-pairing, 
[20:21.74]which is probably Britain's largest collector of data about individuals.
[20:26.14]There are some of us 
[20:27.57]who are fairly predictable. 
[20:29.41]Campbell, for example, as you might expect, 
[20:32.35]is somewhat concentrated 
[20:33.80]in the northern parts of Scotland, 
[20:35.74]and it appears really bizarre to be found somewhere else.
[20:39.97]Well, with 25,000 names as difficult to generalize, 
[20:44.85]what you can do is put them in general categories, 
[20:48.38]if, for example, you look at names 
[20:50.37]which are people's work. 
[20:52.02]Like the name, Webber, 
[20:53.76]you might find it is much more common 
[20:55.80]in the Midlands than in the south of England. 
[20:58.39]If you go to Wales, 
[20:59.69]most people get their names from their ancestors 
[21:02.63]and in Yorkshire for example, 
[21:04.83]a lot of people have names based on the places 
[21:08.03]that they originally lived in 
[21:09.67]or at least their ancestors did.
[21:11.86]Well, we only have 25,000 names on this website, 
[21:16.12]but there are another 50,000 names now 
[21:19.08]found in Britain and they're particularly interesting, 
[21:22.39]for they are non-British names. 
[21:24.67]Most British names are fairly common and about 
[21:28.02]what we can now do as such is looking 
[21:30.97]for the frequency of all names 
[21:33.01]from different parts of the world and different faiths, 
[21:36.00]religions and languages. 
[21:37.79]And what there is in names is actually 
[21:40.64]extremely useful for researchers in anthropology 
[21:44.27]and sociology may find a lot about different 
[21:47.21]immigrant groups and their descendants 
[21:49.46]now living in this country.
[21:52.13]19. What remains the most common surname in Britain?
[22:14.71]20. What is probably Britain's largest collector of data about individuals?
[22:38.96]21. Why is it particularly interesting about another 50,000 names found in Britain?
[23:05.74]Now listen to the following recording and answer questions 22 to 25.
[23:12.31]Ok, let's get started. Great. 
[23:15.56]Today I want to talk about a way 
[23:18.06]in which we are able to determine 
[23:19.90]how old a piece of land, or some other geologic feature is
[23:23.88]---dating techniques. I'm going to talk about 
[23:27.31]a particular dating technique. Why? 
[23:30.35]Good dating is key to good analysis. 
[23:33.88]In other words, if you want to know 
[23:36.27]how a land formation was formed, 
[23:38.51]the first thing you probably want to know 
[23:41.05]is how old it is. It's fundamental.
[23:44.86]Take the Grand Canyon for instance. 
[23:47.47]Now, we geologists thought 
[23:49.91]we had a pretty good idea of 
[23:51.71]how the Grand Canyon 
[23:53.15]in the southwestern United States was formed. 
[23:56.33]We knew that it was formed from sandstone 
[23:59.32]that solidified somewhere 
[24:01.37]between 150 and 300 million years ago. 
[24:06.15]Before it solidified, it was just regular sand. 
[24:10.03]Essentially it was part of a vast desert. 
[24:13.16]And until just recently, 
[24:15.45]most of us thought the sand had come from 
[24:18.04]an ancient mountain range fairly close 
[24:20.48]by that flattened out over time. 
[24:23.28]That's been the conventional wisdom 
[24:25.47]among geologists for quite some time.
[24:28.76]But now we've learned something different, 
[24:31.70]and quite surprising, 
[24:33.39]using a technique called Uranium-Lead Dating. 
[24:37.22]I should say that Uranium-Lead Dating 
[24:39.91]has been around for quite a while. 
[24:42.50]But there have been some recent refinements. 
[24:44.98]I will get into this in a minute.
[24:47.57]Anyway, Uranium-Lead Dating 
[24:50.76]has produced some surprises. 
[24:53.20]Two geologists discovered that about half of the sand 
[24:57.25]from the Grand Canyon was actually 
[24:59.49]once part of the Appalachian Mountains. 
[25:02.60]That's really eye-opening news, 
[25:04.93]since the Appalachian Mountain Range is, 
[25:07.17]of course, thousands of kilometers 
[25:09.66]to the east of the Grand Canyon. 
[25:12.00]Sounds pretty unbelievable, right? 
[25:14.53]Of course, the obvious question 
[25:16.53]is how did that sand end up so far west? 
[25:20.82]The theory is that huge rivers 
[25:23.23]and wind carried the sand west 
[25:25.62]where it mixed in with the sand that was already there.
[25:28.91]Well, this was a pretty revolutionary finding. 
[25:32.50]Um… and it was basically 
[25:34.79]because of Uranium-Lead Dating. 
[25:37.43]Why? Well, as everyone in this class should know, 
[25:40.91]we usually look at the grain type within sandstone, 
[25:45.04]meaning the actual particles in the sandstone, 
[25:48.03]to determine where it came from. 
[25:50.51]You can do other things too, 
[25:52.50]like look at the wind or water 
[25:54.41]that brought the grains to their location 
[25:56.69]and figure out which way it was flowing. 
[25:59.29]But that's only useful up to a point, 
[26:02.01]and that's not what these two geologists did.
[26:05.10]There are a few pretty exciting possibilities 
[26:08.59]for Uranium-Lead Dating. 
[26:10.60]Here is one that comes to mind. 
[26:12.99]You know the theory that earth's continents 
[26:15.92]were once joined together 
[26:17.52]and only split apart relatively recently? 
[26:20.75]Well, with Uranium-Lead Dating, 
[26:22.94]we could prove that more conclusively. 
[26:25.63]If they show evidence of once having been joined, 
[26:28.96]that could really tell us a lot 
[26:31.15]about the early history of the planet's geology.
[26:36.28]22. What is the key to good analysis in geology?
[26:57.41]23. What has been the conventional wisdom among geologists for quite some time?
[27:20.17]24. What has produced some surprises among geologists?
[27:41.88]25. What is one of the exciting possibilities for Uranium-Lead Dating?

[28:05.32]This is the end of Listening Comprehension.
